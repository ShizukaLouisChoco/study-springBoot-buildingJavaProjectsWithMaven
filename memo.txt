Building Java Projects with Maven
    This guide walks you through using Maven to build a simple Java project.

What you’ll build
    You’ll create an application that provides the time of day and then build it with Maven.

Download the project
    git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-maven.git
    cd initial
    mvn -v
        Apache Maven 3.8.6 (84538c9988a25aec085021c365c560670ad80f63)
         Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.6/libexec
         Java version: 18.0.2.1, vendor: Homebrew, runtime: /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/18.0.2.1/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
         Default locale: en_FR, platform encoding: UTF-8
         OS name: "mac os x", version: "12.2.1", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
    cd ..
    cd complete
    mvn -v

1) Set up the project
    First you’ll need to setup a Java project for Maven to build. To keep the focus on Maven, make the project as simple as possible for now. Create this structure in a project folder of your choosing.
